the master has the final REACT code...
I research all things that I aspired to do
I had to alter the vite.config.js to be able to handle the .gif
there were some transition added to the css which transformed....so cool and visually pleasing (kind of like popping packing bubbles)
I had to do some additional imports then definition for the audio, with a function (ln 16) and references at ln 47 & 48 for gif and audio.
So excited about the creative aspect of using REACT. still learning with the growth mindset!!!
